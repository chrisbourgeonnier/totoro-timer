# Totoro Timer
_A Simple Pomodoro Timer_  
After using others' timers for months, I figured I could build and use mine instead.
The added bonus is the possiblity to set our own periods of time.

This was build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You can skip periods, and every 4th break is automatically long break.

Remember to let your browser play the sound for this page in order to hear the alarm at the end of a period.
